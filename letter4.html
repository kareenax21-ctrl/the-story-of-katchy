  Dear PatchBae,
</h3>

<p>
  Four whole years.  Wow.  Who would've thought we'd last so long, given it’s both of our’s first relationship?  We’ve set a standard and goal for those around us, I’d say, and now the only thing left to do is make it 
  official on paper. I can only pray that’s soon. you asked me recently, how do I want to be proposed to?  To be honest, I'm not entirely sure, but as long as it’s you asking me to be yours forever, nothing else matters 
  to me. I can only hope and pray we get engaged soon. while i’m not in a rush per se, it would be nice to take that next step in the coming years. Of course what takes precedence over that is you, your education, and 
  our stability (financially ofc).   <br>
  Speaking of you, hi husband. words cannot describe just how proud I am of you. You’re doing amazingly well in your classes, and gosh it’s so admirable. Physics is no easy topic, but you’re making it look like light work. 
  You’re so talented and brilliant my love. I’m so incredibly lucky to have someone as smart as you by my side. For this past year, you’ve stunned me with your capabilities. You’re nothing less than brilliant. Your 
  hardworking attitude and ambition are incredibly inspiring. You inspire me to be better every day. You’re stepping up for us, and trust me I want to do the same. It’s time to start seriously thinking about & saving for 
  the future. I mean…. I'm sure that temple in trinidad ain’t cheap, lol. <br>
  Internal traits aside, you’re my perfect handsome husband. Truly I have to restrain myself from kissing you up and showing you how much I love you physically.  Your perfect hands, with those pretty long fingers. Those 
  beautiful brown eyes I can easily get lost in. Your cute “villager” nose that I just wanna nibble on. Don’t get me started on your arms…. I'm gonna have to deflate them before you start attracting too much attention. 
  I’m gonna have to latch onto them and never let go, huh, “Latch”man? ;) you get so much more attractive by the day. Truly daddy. <br>
  My perfect boy. I love you so very much. the dearest to my heart, the one I can not do without. No blanket is as warm, no bed is as comforting, no pillow is as restful, as being with you. The one who makes me so warm 
  and fuzzy inside, melts all my problems away with one glance. Makes me feel like the only girl in the world. What could I do without you? Absolutely nothing. The past 4 years have taught me that there’s no one else I
  want to do life with. You’re in every future that I envision. Our first handhold felt electrifying. Our first kiss was exciting.  All of our firsts are normal; a part of our daily life, now. My hands need yours. My lips 
  need yours. It’s not right if you’re not with me. No one else can captivate me like you do. You’ve really got my heart on lock forever, Mr. Boo. My Snuggywuggyumpkin.  You’re the embodiment of the perfect 
  boyfriend/husband/lover/what have you.  My forever love. My one and only. My first and last. I really don’t know what I'd do without you. I love you so so so much. I think of you so often, think about our love and 
  relationship, and it just brings me to tears - how lucky God has made me, when I had never thought any of this was possible for me. My sweet. <br>
  I can’t wait for our wedding. For when I tell you I'm pregnant with our baby. According to my predictive text, after I typed “with our”, we’ll have a daughter then a son. I know you want a son first, but to be honest, 
  I'm okay with having a daughter first. Because that secures the fact that we will definitely have a daughter. If we have a boy first, we have to hope and pray that our next is a girl lol. I’m so excited to tell you when 
  I’ve gotten pregnant. I know you’ll be the best father there is, and I am so excited to see you fill the role. I really can’t wait for our future together. Our lives are just getting started now. <br>
  I promise to you I’m going to be the best version of myself this year. One that you can be incredibly proud of.  I love you forever. Everything I do is for you. For us. For our future. To many more my love, to “4”ever. <3
