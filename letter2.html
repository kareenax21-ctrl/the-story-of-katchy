  To My Bubby Boo,
</h3>

<p>
  Where has time gone? Two years down and a lifetime left to go. So much has happened this year… we crossed a new bridge in our relationship and we’ve grown so much more closer.  In 2 years you’ve made me the happiest i’ve been in a very long time. I didn’t think it was possible for me to feel this level of happiness after the trauma I experienced a few years ago, but you came into my life and showed me otherwise. I’ll always be eternally grateful to you for that. Thanks to you, I have less dark days and dark thoughts.  <br>
  I do feel like in recent months, my mental has been slipping yet again. You’ve definitely noticed it but kindly never said anything. You just deal with it head on and never complain. I’m fully aware that recently, I’ve been crying a lot more when we call and I get upset a lot more easily. I’m not sure why it’s been happening. As of July, I’ve been emotionally declining. I struggle to open up about it but I’ve been overthinking and have different “dark” thoughts. I’m struggling with different things that I don’t want to burden you with, but they eat at my heart and my mind. I’m not yet in a place where I feel comfortable talking about it. Believe me when I say I am so deeply sorry for letting it out on you when we call by getting upset and crying. I’m so sorry for putting you through this, you don’t deserve it one bit. I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for not getting fed up with it. Well, you probably are/have, but you don’t show it. You still show me the utmost purest love, genuine concern, and reassurance.  I really do appreciate it. Your patience with me is mind blowing, but I truly do love you and appreciate you for it.  Thank you my love, for not yelling at me, for being patient with me, being understanding, and still treating me with love. I’ll never understand it but I will always be grateful and try to do better.  <br>
  Through this “letter”, I want to tell you some things that I struggle telling you upfront. Its very difficult for me to speak about it, and we’ve had the discussion here and there, but I don’t say everything that I want to say. That is 100% my fault but I can’t get past myself and just say it.  Though this year has been absolutely amazing, you and I both know where it lacked.  It’s not your fault, and you say it isn’t mine.  While I still struggle to believe that, for the sake of us, I will not blame myself here.  Though this year has been really hard for me in that aspect.  When we first started getting sexual in December 2021, you made all the first moves.  I was always shy and hesitant, so it was you making the moves.  It was a bit hard for me at first, when we moved past the dirty talk.  I was never comfortable sending nudes but you wanted them, so I did it just for you.  And I kept doing it until I felt comfortable, and until I felt ready to begin making first moves.  You were always more in tune with your self sexually than I was.  And it feels like…shortly after I felt comfortable being sexual with you and initiating first moves, I was left high and dry.  You increased my sex drive that had been pretty low for years, and then I was left to deal with it alone.  That was, and still is, so hard to deal with.  We agreed we both wouldn’t watch porn when we started getting sexual.  And I feel so gross and disgusted with myself for breaking that rule earlier this year.  I had used my imagination, memory, and old nudes for months until I couldn’t anymore.  Even now, whenever we do get sexual in real life, I use that memory to help myself, but even that can only last a week.  I feel so disgusted with myself.  Disgusted, guilty… and every time I just wish we could go back to last year.  Last year when I would tell you and we’d help each other.  Even now, when we do get sexual together, it doesn’t feel right.  Sometimes it feels forced.  On my end, I sometimes feel like I want you to satisfy me in a way that fantasies cannot, If that makes sense.  When we do have sex, neither of us gets anything out of it, so what’s the point?  Why do we do it?  And why do I keep asking for it…?  Our sex is nothing like what we promised each other when we first began talking about it.  I question if you’re really ever into it, or getting pleasure from it.  The hatred I hold for myself is probably unhealthy and it leads me to wonder, why do I even ask you to have sex with me or help me orgasm, when you probably aren’t sexually attracted to me.  I wouldn’t be attracted to myself, so I wonder why I would expect you to be.  That brings me into my next point… <br>
  The vouchers.  I’ll be honest with you, this really does hurt me on a whole new level.  I cry to you about it, we hang up, and I continue to cry wondering why I even brought it up to begin with.  I created the vouchers not only because it was kind of your idea, but because I thought it could enhance our sex lives and bring it back to what it used to be.  I was even fine with it being used in a non-sexual context.  I just kind of missed the feeling of being wanted, missed the feeling of you asking to see snaps of me.  Since they expire in two days, you’re not going to see the one voucher that I really wanted you to use.  Pause reading here, go to your email, and look for Voucher #29.  It so deeply hurts me that not even half of the vouchers were used within 6 months.  It makes me feel stupid and embarrassed.  I feel stupid for putting myself out there and getting no where with it.  I feel embarrassed for wanting that attention, not getting it, and then needing to bring it up to you.  I’ve struggled with my self-esteem for as long as I can remember, and this drives me down into the ground.  It’s not your fault.  My self-image issues are not your fault.  I end up in this cycle where I want a certain type of attention, don’t receive it, and feel stupid and embarrassed for wanting it and even thinking I deserved it.  I don’t deserve it.  I’m not attractive enough to deserve it.  <br>
  That’s all that I wanted to say in terms of things I struggle to bring up.  Onto the next! ♥ <br>
  Thank you for being there for me all the time.  This past year has not been easy, juggling school, work, my internship, my social life, and us.  Your understanding and support means the world to me.  I genuinely believe that our daily calls has done a lot of good for our relationship.  It’s fostered more love and attachment for one another.  Thinking back on this year, we hardly saw each other for the first half.  Our only dates were our January 16th and Valentines Day.  It was so hard, not being able to see you and spend time with you.  I feel like when we began to call every night, it really did help a lot.  Every single day, I look forward to the nighttime so we can call and I get to see your heavenly face.  I love you.  I love looking at you.  You’re so perfect, inside and out.  I wonder how I got so lucky to meet someone as sweet and handsome as you.  Playing with you, watching shows/movies with you, and just talking to you is my favorite part of my day.  On days that you work, I try to plan my day around when you’re going home or have break so that I can talk to you.  I try to go gym early enough so that you can call me, after I’m fresh and clean at home, during break.  I postpone my showers or shower early so we can call during break or your drive home.  I really love being on call with you, whether we’re just existing or talking to each other.  All my stress melts away when I’m talking to you.  I love you and I can’t wait to live my life with you. <br>
  The only motivation I have pushing me through life is getting to marry you and build a family with you.  I absolutely cannot wait for the days when we’re married, working, and can travel the world together.  Going to the beaches of the Bahamas, Barbados, Maldives, Turks and Caicos, hand in hand.  Visiting Shibuya hand in hand to see where our favorite characters have died.  Wandering the streets of Tokyo together, experiencing the scenes we’ve seen in anime together in real life.  Experiencing cherry blossom season together, having them litter the ground around us.  Visiting Korea and seeing everything it has to offer; visiting all the places BTS has publicly eaten at, filmed at, etc.  Going to Venice and rowing a little boat down the river together.  Cuddling each other while seeing the lit up Eiffel Tower from our hotel room.  Battling the heat of Hollywood while we walk down the Walk of Fame.  There’s no one else I want to experience these things with but you.  There is no doubt in my mind that you are my absolute soulmate.  You said it yourself a few weeks ago, and I think I really needed that reminder. I want to experience all that life has to offer with you.  I cannot wait for the days that await us in which we get to experience it all. <br>
  Forget all the good, I want to experience all the bad in life with you as well.  I want to be there for you when you’re sick.  As soon as you need to puke, I’m there behind you rubbing your back and helping it all come out.  I’m there with a box of tissues (or wearing an old t-shirt) in case you need to blow your nose. I want to massage your back with essential oils, or infused-lotions, when you have back pain.  If you have knee pain or foot pain I won’t hesitate to massage those areas as well.  I want to be the one rubbing Vicks on you when you’re sick, patting Limacol in your head and in your skin when you have a fever.  I want to feed you fruit salt (and introduce it to you really) when you feel nauseous.  I want to physically be there when you need a shoulder to cry on.  I want to be able to wipe your tears whenever you need me to.  I want to hug you on the days where you feel like you need a break or can’t move on.  I want to shower you with kisses on the days that feel hardest.  I want to hug and kiss you every day, good or bad.  I just want to be there for you and provide you all the love and support you need.  It hurts my heart when you’re sick and I can’t do anything to take care of you.  I even want to be there when you have diarrhea and need a hand to hold while fighting for your life! <br>
  Seeing all these babies on TikTok, especially Juliet and Gianna, have made me crave building a family with you.  I’ve thought millions of times about how I’d break the news to you if I find out I’m pregnant.  All these different scenarios and ideas have gone through my head.  You’d be at work, I’d take a couple of tests, and surprise you when you come home.  Do I surprise you with a baby outfit?  Do I give you the test?  Do I give you a t-shirt or a cup that says “#1 Daddy” on it?  I haven’t settled on an idea just yet, but I can’t wait for the day I get to tell you “I’m pregnant!” Don’t even get me started on gender reveal ideas… that’s a whole other ballpark.  But there is no doubt in my mind that you will be the best father ever.  I’ll probably envy our children for having such an amazing father when I couldn’t.  I can’t wait for the day I give birth, with you by my side, and we welcome our beautiful mini-we into the world.  It’ll be the best day of my life. <br>
  I can’t wait for the days our baby and I will be home, waiting until you come home.  You’ll open the door, I’m holding our baby.  They’ll see you and get so excited… the biggest smile on their face, eyes lit up, and they start to reach for you.  They start to kick their legs with excitement and extend their arms towards their perfect, loving father.  While you hold our baby, you’ll follow me into the dining room where you see our food waiting for us.  I finished cooking just a few minutes before you got home.  After you shower, we’ll eat, and us three will cuddle up and watch TV together before bed time.  The most perfect days of our lives.  <br>
  I’ve imagined all there is to our future.  Our engagement, wedding, pregnancies, living life with our children, traveling, everything.  I can’t wait to experience everything with you.  The one thing I’m looking forward to, in the hopefully near future, is us going home together after our date.  Instead of you getting off at Kew Gardens, we both get off at the same time, and walk together.  Hand in hand.  Arm in arm.  That’s when I’ll really start thinking “we made it.” <br>
  I love you more than words can describe, my Bubby Boo.  Believe me.  I don’t ever want to lose you.  I love you more than life itself and I would do absolutely anything for you.  With no hesitation I’d give up my life for you.  I can’t wait to spoil you next year and be in my sugar mommy era.  But yeah, I really do mean it when I say I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, especially in this past year.  You were able to help surprise me for my birthday, giving me not even a hint of it.  You spoiled me to no end.  I mean, who else would willingly buy me what I wanted from Sephora?  I am absolutely so, so lucky to have you.  And no amount of words can describe how deeply it touched me when you Ubered boba to me.  Not once, but twice.  When I was feeling like such shit and had all these negative thoughts spiraling in my head.  You were just a ray of sunshine in my heart, doing your best to make me feel happy.  You really are the most sweetest and loving person. <br>
  I am so proud of you.  I really am.  I am in awe of you, actually.  You have been working your ass off, non-stop.  Since you re-enrolled last year, you haven’t taken a break.  I know you’re tired my love.  Not only are you tired from school, but balancing it with work as well.  Working at Micro in general is just a pain.  And while I do think you should take a break, I am so proud of you.  Literally no one could do it like you.  Who else could major in CS, work a job, and go to school with absolutely 0 break?  You’re actually smurfing in real life.  I see the hard work you do my love.  You’re the most hardworking person I know, truly.  Your determination is inspiring.  I really am so lucky to have such an ambitious husband.  Please take a break in the summer my love.  You deserve a break.  You’ve been working with hardly any breaks for a whole year.  Your “breaks” last a week, hardly.  If you have a break from school, it’s interrupted by work.  Nonetheless, whatever you choose my love, I will always be behind you.  I am your #1 fan, supporting you and rooting for you through and through.  I hope you remember that you can always talk to me when things get tough.  But again, I really am soooooo proud of my husband.  Your hard work will get you very far in life, I promise.  I know you’re feeling burnt out.  You’re almost done.  Take that summer break, please.  You absolutely deserve it.  You deserve it and so much more.  You deserve to get every wish you have granted in life.  You’re the most deserving person I know. <br>
  As long as I’m alive and breathing, you’ll never have to lie awake at night wondering if anyone cares about you.  You’ll never have to go to sleep feeling alone in this world.  And you’ll never have to go another day without feeling loved.  For I absolutely adore you.  <br>
  Life is just different with you.  Different in the best way possible.  You make me feel safe, seen, and understood.  You respect me for who I am and the person I'm growing to become.  We dream together, we laugh together, we can sit in silence together comfortably.  I've never felt love like this before.  You are made for me, and I am made for you.  Our humor matches like no other.  I can gossip with you so easily, and you'll hop on the same bandwagon and agree with what I say.  I love you for that.  I love us for that.  <br>
  You keep my heart safe.  Your hugs quiet my mind.  Your energy lights up my soul.  Your laughter makes me feel at home.  I have finally found the love I dreamed about.  I've found someone who I can trust with every fiber of my being, for as I've never felt as protected as I do with you.  You've shown me it's possible to trust (a Guyanese person especially) and not get destroyed in the process. <br>
  I love you.  I love your <i>eyes</i>, your <i>smile</i>, your <i>nose</i>, your <i>patience</i>, your <i>kindness</i>, your <i>energy</i>, your <i>laughter</i>, your <i>heart</i>, and your <b><i>soul</i></b>.
<br>
  Happy 2 Year Anniversary Brandan, you are the absolute love of my life.  I can’t wait for 2 to turn into 20.
