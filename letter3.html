  Dear My Love,
</h3>

<p>
  Three years, wow. We’re definitely locked in at this point, right? Riiiiiight? <br>
  I can’t believe we’ve been together for a whole 3 years, my love. Time is really flying by. This past year was definitely a hard one, emotionally but also in relation to physical for you. I’m sorry that this year has been so tough on you my love, and I can’t begin to imagine how you feel. However I am so, so proud of you for still fighting and getting through everything. You’ve overcome an unfortunate accident and it’s repercussions while also pushing yourself through classes. Not many can say they’ve done that, but you have, and you did it amazingly. I don’t tell you this enough but I really do admire you for getting through it. You make it look easy, even though I know that’s furthest from the truth. <br>
  When we talked back in March (?) about you dropping your classes, I won't lie, I was really scared and worried about you. It was when I realized you keep a lot of things to yourself as a means to not worry me, but I wish you wouldn’t do that. You proved this to me again when you suddenly told me you wanted to switch to physics, when just a couple months before you explained that you were interested in machine learning and wanted to create a startup. I'm always going to support you and whatever you want. I’ve realized now, you’re not entirely sure about what you want (career-wise), and that’s okay. I’ll always be here to hold your hand and help you navigate the forest that is life.  You can always talk to me and we’ll figure things out together. I’m your other half, I want to be your backbone and support you through everything. In this life, my love, there’s you, there’s me, and the best part? There’s us. <br>
  I know I haven’t been the easiest person to be with this past year, and for that, I'm sorry, my love. I’m trying to do better and be less of a nuisance on you especially when you’re dealing with so much other things. I think my issue really was that I miss you a lot. I’ve been so happy the last month and a half, getting to see you a couple times a week. Seeing you heals my heart, as you’re the only medication I need in this life. You make everything better. <br>
  I really cannot wait for our future together, my love. Every morning when I drop Deece to school, I never cease to look around me and think, “I can’t wait for it to be us one day.” It’s a daily routine I never skip out on. Imagining a life where we drop our kids off to school — either you do it on your way to work, I do it after you’ve left, or we do it together.  The biggest excitement of it is there being a mixture of you and me.  I can’t look at people around me normally anymore. That random 40-year-old couple across the street? I can’t wait for that to be us one day. That family with the mom, dad, and 2 kids? I can’t wait for us to be that one day. Whether it be a movie or real life, I look for us in anything and everything. <br>
  I love you so much my perfect boy. Life is meaningless without you.  Your arms are my safe haven that I miss every second, it’s the only place I ever want to be. Our hugs and cuddle sessions mean absolutely everything to me, and I wish they could last forever.  No blanket is as warm, no bed is as comforting, no pillow is as restful as being with you. I am 100% grounded in my belief that the only thing I need in this life (and every yet to come) is you. <br>
  Words can’t describe the love or appreciation I have for you, my bubby boo. You’re my favorite person, who I love the absolute most and cannot live without. I’m so attached you and I never want to be removed. This has been yet another year of me being in awe of your hard work, ambition, and perseverance. You’re so smart my love, I really am jealous.  I know right now you’re worried about multivariable calculus, but I know if there’s anyone who can pass that class, it’s you. You’re absolutely brilliant my love. On top of that, you’re the absolute sweetest and most loving person ever. I won the lottery of love when you walked into my life. Hell, I won the lottery in general. You’re perfect in every single way and more (yes i know that doesn’t make sense). I can’t wait find you in every life that’s yet to come. Life didn’t begin until I met you, because you are my life. You’re so kind to me, in ways more than 1, and I’ll always be eternally grateful for your sweet heart, love, and good mind. I didn’t think love could be so amazing and perfect until you gave me the world. I love you so much my boy. So, so much. Never change, please, and never leave me. I know you love me very much and I hope you know I love you even more than that. <br>
  Happy 3 years, my love, I can’t wait for us to add a 0 to that 3. I hope our jinx stays in 2024 because not being able to see you is worse than death. Mwa mwa mwa. To many more :) <br>
