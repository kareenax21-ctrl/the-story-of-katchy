  Happy Anniversary, My Love!

<p>
  It all happened on the fateful night of December 7th, 2021.  Kareena was bored and was playing Valorant to practice and hone her skills.  After all, she was procrastinating doing her work and had nothing else to do.  Latchman, who was already amazing at Valorant, was coming online to play with his friends.  Instead of clicking his friend's name to request to join them, he accidentally clicked on Kareena's name without realizing.  Kareena, thinking that Sangeeta told him she was going to play, accepted so that all three would queue together.  Upon realizing his mistake, Latchman revealed that it was an accident but promised he'd play with Kareena later.  Kareena accepted and waited for him.  That night, they played quite a bit together, and added each other on Discord.  The rest is history, and they are now a very happy couple.
