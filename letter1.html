  Dear Latchman,
</h3>

<p>
  I can't believe we've made it to one year already.  I'm so proud of us!  But moreso I'm proud of you.  I don't know how, but you were able to manage being a fantastic boyfriend while also being a superb student and Micro Center worker.  You even managed to do it while being "totally disabled".  You never once let any of your hardships get in the way of being a loving + supporting boyfriend, and I'm really so grateful for that.  Every day you make me fall more and more in love with you.  Whenever I thought of my first relationship, I never gave it much standard.  All I really wanted was someone who was loyal, funny, gamed, and watched anime.  I don't know, I never really gave much thought on how I wanted them to treat me, as weird as that sounds.  After being on social media for so many years, I've heard so many horror stories about mean, abusive, and overall terrible boyfriends.  But with you... I never once had to worry about anything.  I really have to hand it to you, for this being your first "real" relationship, you're doing amazing.  You never fail to make me feel loved, appreciated, and supported.  I've never once had to question your loyalty to me or wonder if the relationship was worth it.  You have showed me what love is and what I've been missing all my life.  Love is a beautiful thing and I only want to receive it from you.  You are quite literally my everything.  I'm always thinking of you, no matter what I'm doing.  You've never left my mind once since I started to like you.  Not to mention, I'm always praying for your safety.  I realized how much I truly loved and cared for you when you went to Guyana in March.  I'm not lying when I say I cried at least twice every day.  I missed you so much, and I was constantly hoping you were alive and safe.  That Saturday morning when you left, I woke up and cried my eyes out until they were swollen.  I was praying the plane would make it there safely without crashing, without getting hijacked, etc.  Up to now I'm always hoping that you're being smart while you're driving.  I wouldn't be able to handle it if anything happened to you.  You are supposed to be the one I marry and have children with, and you promised me you would never leave me.  I'm holding you to that promise.  
  You have made such an impact on me, it's insane.  I truly love you with my whole heart, soul, literally every fiber of my being.  Nothing makes me happier than being by your side.  All of my stress and worries melt away when I'm with you.  I love to look at you and admire your face, wondering which features our children will get from you.  I never thought I would find a love so beautiful and pure this early in my life, but I'm so happy that I did.  I want to experience all life has to offer with you by my side.  I don't remember if I told you this, but in September-October of last year (2021), I was planning on doing a semester in Korea with Zubaida.  Queens College is part of this all-expenses-paid study abroad program, where if you take certain language classes for a specific amount of time, you can apply to take part.  We were going to apply for this year, because to go to Korea, you needed to have learned the language for at least 2 semesters.  My second semester of Korean finished in Spring 2022, which would've allowed us to apply together this fall.  However, I met and fell in love with you a couple months later, and decided against it.  When I fell in love with you, I quickly threw the thought of going out the window.  I could never bare being so far away from you for so long - I'd probably go insane or die from missing you.  
  I really don't know how God managed to bring me luck by giving me the gift of you.  I am smitten by every single aspect of you, both inside and outside.  You have the personality that matches mine in the best way possible.  You understand my sense of humor and we have so much in common.  Not only that, but you truly get me.  You're able to predict my words, my actions, and everything so well.  I never thought I'd have someone pay such good attention to me that they'd get everything right.  You are so much more than anything I'd want in a friend and significant other.  I never thought I'd find someone who was able to understand my sense of humor and match it perfectly, someone who would laugh at my jokes and at me when I'm being "silly".  I'm 101% certain that you are my soulmate.  You are so perfect - the perfect son, the perfect boyfriend/future husband/future father, the perfect FPS player, the perfect student, the perfect Micro worker... the perfect everything.  I am constantly in awe of you and how you're so good at everything.  You're also so sweet.  It makes my heart melt when I see how you take care of your mom and your friends.  One thing that I love about you is your pure heart.  It's actually made of gold.  You're so thoughtful and kind.  It's so sweet when you talk about someone and you start to ramble about how good they are, saying "they're such a genuine person frfr".  You also make me feel so loved.  I have so many insecurities and you somehow always look past them and continue to love me.  I really don't know how you do it, but I love you.  I'll never forget the time we almost did the deed in March, and I started getting scared because my insecurities were taking over.  You held me tight and said "Kareena, I'm your husband, and I love you no matter what, okay?" When you said that, it absolutely solidified that I wanted to marry you.  It was one of the most loving and wholesome things ever.  Another one of our moments that I hold really close to my heart is that one time we were on FaceTime, and I told you how insecure I felt about my forehead and nose.  The next day, we were together in person, and you stopped kissing my lips to kiss my forehead and nose.  After kissing my forehead, you said "I love this forehead", and after kissing my nose you said "I love this nose".  Every time I think of that moment
  I start crying.  It was the most purest/sweetest thing I'd ever experienced.  Not to mention, it always warmed my heart when you would buy bubble tea and drop it home for me.  You are truly my favorite person to walk planet Earth.  Oh, I also love looking into your eyes.  Your eyes are so pretty - I really do hope our children inherit them from you.  They're so bright and perfect.  They have to inherit your smarts as well.  I've never met someone as smart and ambitious as you.  You know what you want and you're more than willing to put in the necessary work to achieve it.  Actually, you go above and beyond.  You truly astounded me when you took it upon yourself to teach yourself coding C++ before learning it in school.  You also write so eloquently, and you're amazing at math.  I truly wish I could get even a crumb of your brilliance.  I'm absolutely so lucky to have you, and I envy every other girl you've had romantic interest in.  I'm going to have to get angy, fr fr.  Anyways my love, our love story is my absolute favorite.  By a twist of fate we are now together and happier than ever.  All because of a misclick.  A silly little mistake turned out to be the best mistake you could have ever made.  It impacted not only one but two people for the better.  Before I met you, I didn't think I could be happy again.  Here I am, happier than ever now that I have the love of my life by my side.  My love who never hesitates to give me reassurance when I need it, which is on the more frequent side, yet he still does it.  You are truly the most understanding boyfriend.  I really do love you so much.  More than I could ever put into words.  You truly are my perfect pretty boy.  You bring happiness to so many people around you, and I promise to bring you happiness in the same way.  You deserve a life filled with good, and I'll do anything to make sure you get it.  My Brandan Baby only deserves the best of the best.  If I were to die now, I'd die happy knowing I was able to meet you and spend time with you.  You know, whenever I look at you, I feel happy.  Not only does looking at your pretty face make me smile, but you also have a widow's peak.  It makes me happy that you have one and you don't.  It means that you'll end up a widow -- I'll die before you.  That is truly fantastic news for me, because I would not be able to live a day without you.  I don't ever want 
  to go back to a life that you're not in.  You are my happiness, my love, my sunshine, my life, my everything.  Without you, I'm truly nothing.  I could never live without you.  So I'm happy that I will die first - you'll be with me up until my end.  I love you forever and ever, and I hope that we will always find each other in all of our lives and live happily together.  I love you Latchman.  I hope writing this and making your website was able to properly show that, because I kind of struggle to demonstrate just how much I love you.  Happy 1 year my love.  Happy anniversary.  I can't wait to say it every year for the rest of our lives.  I love you.
